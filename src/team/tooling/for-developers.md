# For developers

### Source-Control Management

<picture><source srcset="../../.gitbook/assets/git-logo-dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/git-logo-light.svg" alt="" data-size="line"></picture>\
We use [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) software for tracking the changes in any set of computer files, also for coordinating work related to the development scope.

### Development Platform

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/git-logo-light.svg" alt="" data-size="line">\
We use [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) as a main hosting service for our code repositories. It also aligns with one of our core values - [Trust and Amplify](../../company/mission-vision-and-values.md#trust-and-amplify) - we are open-source company.

### CI & CD

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/git-logo-light.svg" alt="" data-size="line">\
Currently we use [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/features/actions) for [CI](../../everyone/glossary.md#ci) & [CD](../../everyone/glossary.md#cd) automation.

***

### Translations

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/git-logo-light.svg" alt="" data-size="line">\
We use [**inlang**](https://inlang.com) to provide an ecosystem for [i18n](../../everyone/glossary.md#i18n) and [l10n](../../everyone/glossary.md#l10n) purposes.

{% hint style="info" %}
The easiest way to modify the atomised pieces of translation messages is using one of inlang’ apps - [Fink](https://fink.inlang.com/).\
**If you have spotted any translation mistakes, please help us!** :pray:

### UI components

For the stable flow of collaborating with designers, we use [**Chromatic**](https://chromatic.com/) platform to host our [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/)(s) - a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. We use it for UI development, testing, and documentation. It’s open source and free.
