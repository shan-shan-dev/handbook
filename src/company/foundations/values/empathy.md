# Empathy

**We remember that we are humans.**

We remember that our imperfection is wired into us.

We remember that anyone could make a mistake, even the best or most experienced ones. While we try our best to prevent them from happening, we also focus on learning from them.

> _"Empathy is really the opposite of spiritual meanness. It’s the capacity to understand that every war is both won and lost. And that someone else’s pain is as meaningful as your own."_

> **Barbara Kingsolver**

That means we support each other when something goes wrong; skip the negativity, approach every case with understanding, compassion, and encourage moving forward.
