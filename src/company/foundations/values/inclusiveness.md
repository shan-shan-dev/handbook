# Inclusiveness

**Our company has ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ANY SORT OF DISCRIMINATION.**

Pun intended on the capital wording.

We want to make it clear that no matter who you are, the mistakes you've made, or the knowledge you have, everyone should feel welcome**.**

We treat everyone with fairness.

And also, **we don't confuse equality with equity**.

We know this is a very sensitive subject. Regardless, we want to ensure everyone in our company understands our firm opinion on this matter.

We will do our best to preserve and showcase this state for as long as we remain.
