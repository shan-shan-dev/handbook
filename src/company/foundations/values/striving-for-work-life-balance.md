# Striving for work-life balance

**We are a remote and async company.**

We preserve this work setup, and we acknowledge that it is not for everyone and challenging to maintain.

While we're at it, we want to build a workspace culture where we focus on health and mental well-being by inviting the team to retreat once in a while to recharge batteries and decompress.

We want to preserve a holistic approach for each team member's needs and give them a chance to take care of what matters most to them.
