> _“The wind might cause a kite to rise, but what keeps it up there is the fact that somebody on the ground has a steady hand. You have to hold steady to your values – your integrity. It’s your anchor. You let go of that... well, it isn’t long before your kite comes crashing down.”_

It is the essence that permeates all aspects of our existence. It will shape our actions, decisions, and interactions even when no one is watching.
