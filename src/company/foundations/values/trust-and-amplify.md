It comes with overtrust.

We are aware that someone could just copy our hard work for their own gain. We believe that such action will only amplify our recognition and hope it will do no harm to our financial sustainability.

We will remain, as **our philosophy is to contribute to the movement of open source** by being an integral part of it and setting an example of what we envision for the future of the work.
