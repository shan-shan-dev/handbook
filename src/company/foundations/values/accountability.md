What we said, what we promised.

Including our personal successes, or our mistakes.

> _"Being held accountable is an act of generosity and compassion. It is a gift that someone gives us to correct our wrongs, unlearn, and do better for the sake of our own growth. It might be uncomfortable, but it is worth the discomfort."_\

**We take profound responsibility** for whatever we do that could slow down or negatively affect the growth of the company, projects, other team members and our community.
