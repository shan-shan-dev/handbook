# ðŸŒ³ Foundations

### Preamble

[**Cal.com**](https://handbook.cal.com) **has been a major source of inspiration for us.** Their dedication to being an open-source company and their transparency in their work and handbook allowed us to observe, reflect, and shape our own path.\
I have no doubt you may find a lot of similarities _(specifically_ [_our values_](values/)_)_ between our company and theirs. And for good reason. While we're working on different products, we'd like to credit them and point out how we came to these foundations, which you can read in this chapter.
