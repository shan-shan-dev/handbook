### Values

#### :digit\_one:Trust and amplify

**We are an open-source company**. We are aware that someone could take code of our project and launch a rip-off using our hard-work for their own benefits. Regardless, we will remain to be open-source.\
Our philosophy is to be [truly transparent](mission-vision-and-values.md#true-transparency-and-honesty), and we hope that by doing any such nefarious attempts would only boost our brand recognition, and do no damage to our financial sustainability. In other words, we remain optimistic by over-trusting.

#### :digit\_two:Demonstrating integrity and foundational

**Integrity is our north star that illuminates the path of our company.** We are committed to creating positive change through the tools we build. We want to push the hospitality industry to have an simpler and easier life with the products and services. It's the essence that permeates every aspect of our existence. It will shape our actions, decisions, and interactions even when no one is watching.\
We are committed to living in alignment with our values and principles, which is evident through fostering our true transparency and accountability. Our [open-book](mission-vision-and-values.md#true-transparency-and-honesty) policy ensures that our community has access to our decision-making processes.

#### :digit\_three:True transparency and honesty

**We want to be an open-book company to our community**, so they can understand us better, and [feel welcoming](mission-vision-and-values.md#inclusiveness-and-empathy) to get involved in our endeavours. Our work progress should be trackable and visible to the public eye. We will always overshare, regardless of your position in the company. \
That includes being honest with each other, even when the things go side ways, also with the public. We believe this is how we can maintain any form of trust and build stronger teamwork spirits.

#### :digit\_four:Inclusiveness and empathy

**Our company has no place for any sort of discrimination**. No matter who you are, the mistakes you've done, the knowledge you have. **Everyone should feel welcoming.** Even when things go side ways, we will always approach to every case with understanding, and offer a support to each other regardless of position in the company.\
We also hope that our open and global salary policy makes compensation more fair and inclusive. That means equal pay for equal jobs, regardless of location, gender, race, or anything else.
