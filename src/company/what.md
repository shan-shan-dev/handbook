# ❓ What is Shan-Shan?

### Who are we?

We are **Remote and Async** company _(a software house to be more precise)_ which builds SaaS products to bring simplicity to the hospitality-based industries staff workflows, and make their life easier.

### What's up with the name?

**It's a temporary placeholder**, and at the moment of creation I thought of the local cat in Jiufen _(Taiwan)_ whose name is 山山 _/shān-shān/_, but speaking in third tone 閃閃 _/shǎn-shǎn/_ gives it a different meaning - **sparkle** :sparkles:.
