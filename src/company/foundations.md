# üå≥ Foundations

### Preamble

<picture><source srcset="https://cal.com/logo-white.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://cal.com/logo.svg" alt="" data-size="line"></picture>

[**Cal.com**](https://handbook.cal.com) **has been a major source of inspiration for us.** Their dedication to being an open-source company and their transparency in their work and handbook allowed us to observe, reflect, and shape our own path.\
I have no doubt you may find a lot of similarities _(specifically_ [_values_](foundations.md#values)_)_ between our company and theirs. And for good reason. While we're working on different products, we'd like to credit them and point out how we came to these foundations, which you can read below.

***

### Mission

> * _What do we do today?_
> * _What do we serve?_
> * _What we're trying to accomplish?_
> * _What impact we want to achieve?_

{% hint style="success" %}
**Our mission is to simplify and ease the work for the staff of any size of company related to the hospitality industry.**
{% endhint %}

We have one focus. Help the hospitality industry by developing innovative solutions purely tailored for them. We're aiming to dismantle the complexities that often overshadow the day-to-day tasks of hospitality staff. We're dedicating ourselves to finding ways to simplify their inner processes, so they have more time for themselves and the energy to provide exceptional service experiences.

***

### Vision

> * _Where are we going moving forward?_
> * _What do we want to achieve in the future?_
> * _What kind of future society do we envision?_

{% hint style="success" %}
**We make hospitality life simpler and easier.**
{% endhint %}

In pursuit of this vision, we relentlessly strive to make hospitality life simpler and easier for the staff. We envision a future where our solutions redefine the way businesses operate, empowering the hospitality ecosystem to also focus on maintaining the happiness level of the hospitality staff. Then they can provide even more exceptional guest experiences without the burden of complex and time-consuming tasks or tools.

***

### Values

> * _What do we stand for?_
> * _What behaviours do we value over all else?_
> * _How will we conduct our activities to achieve our mission and vision?_
> * _How we treat members of our own organisation and community?_

#### ‚ôæÔ∏è The Hero's Journey <a href="#the-hero-journey" id="the-hero-journey"></a>

<figure><img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/023/971/901/large/danissa-sandykbayeva-hero-s-journey.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Illustration of a Hero's Journey. <strong>Credits:</strong> <a href="https://sanddan.artstation.com/"><strong>Danissa Sandykbayeva</strong></a></p></figcaption></figure>

**Continuous development is at the core of what we stand for.** It unites all of the other values we believe in. It means that while we are small by design, we are staying humble at heart. We are able to self-reflect and preserve a growth mindset, which involves ongoing self-improvement, skill enhancement, and knowledge acquisition throughout the entire career in our company.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£Trust and amplify <a href="#trust-and-amplify" id="trust-and-amplify"></a>

**We are an open-source company.** It comes with overtrust. We are aware that someone could just copy our hard work for their own gain. We believe that such action will only amplify our recognition and hope it will do no harm to our financial sustainability.\
We will remain, as our philosophy is to contribute to the movement of open source by being an integral part of it and setting an example of what we envision for the future of the work.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£Demonstrating integrity <a href="#demonstrating-integrity" id="demonstrating-integrity"></a>

**Integrity is our North Star, guiding our company's path.** We are committed to bringing about positive change by developing foundational tools for the hospitality industry to make life easier. It is the essence that permeates all aspects of our existence. It will shape our actions, decisions, and interactions even when no one is watching.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£True transparency <a href="#true-transparency" id="true-transparency"></a>

**We want to be an open-book company for our community.** We want to help them understand us better and feel welcome to get involved in our endeavours, including the decision-making process. Our work progress should be trackable and visible to the public.&#x20;

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£Honesty <a href="#honesty" id="honesty"></a>

When things go sideways or we have doubts or concerns, we are honest about them. Between ourselves (the team) and the public. We believe this is how we can maintain any form of trust and live up to our values.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£Empathy <a href="#empathy" id="empathy"></a>

**We remember that we are humans.** We remember that our imperfection is wired into us. We remember that anyone could make a mistake, even the best or most experienced ones. While we try our best to prevent them from happening, we also focus on learning from them. That means we support each other when something goes wrong; skip the negativity, approach every case with understanding, and encourage moving forward.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£Inclusiveness <a href="#inclusiveness" id="inclusiveness"></a>

**Our company has ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ANY SORT OF DISCRIMINATION.** Pun intended on the capital wording. We want to make it clear that no matter who you are, the mistakes you've made, or the knowledge you have, everyone should feel welcome**.** We treat everyone with fairness, and **we don't confuse equality with equity**. We do our best to preserve and showcase this state for as long as we remain.

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£Rigorousness <a href="#rigorousness" id="rigorousness"></a>

**We care about the way we attain our objectives.** We actively do our best to involve everyone in the decision-making process. Our approach involves careful consideration of the consequences of each solution we pursue. Striving for balance, we seek compromises that align with both immediate needs and long-term goals.

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£Accountability <a href="#accountability" id="accountability"></a>

**We take ownership of our actions.** What we said, our personal successes, or our mistakes. We take profound responsibility for whatever we do that could slow down or negatively affect the growth of the company, projects, other team members and our community.

#### 9Ô∏è‚É£Sustainability <a href="#sustainability" id="sustainability"></a>

**We strive to ensure the longevity of our company** by operating in a capital-efficient manner. Whenever possible, we prioritise long-term decisions over short-term gains. In the long run, we consider critical aspects such as employee well-being, regulatory compliance, environmental stewardship, or economic viability.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£**Striving for work-life balance** <a href="#striving-for-work-life-balance" id="striving-for-work-life-balance"></a>

**We are a remote and async company.** We preserve this work setup, and we acknowledge that it is not for everyone and challenging to maintain.\
While we're at it, we want to build a workspace culture where we focus on health and mental well-being by inviting the team to retreat once in a while to recharge batteries and decompress. We want to preserve a holistic approach for each team member's needs and give them a chance to take care of what matters most to them.
