# ðŸ“– Shan-Shan Handbook

**Greetings**! :tophat:

Welcome to our official _handbook_ :notebook\_with\_decorative\_cover:.\

_**"What's handbook?"**_ - you might be asking.\
Well, if you did, I'm glad you asked!

>
> **Think of it as your pocket-sized friend**, always there to help you navigate the ins and outs of a particular subject.
>
> So, **whenever you have questions or need a bit of guidance, just flip open this handbook**, and hopefully you'll find the answers you're looking for! And if not, please feel to contribute. :heart:
