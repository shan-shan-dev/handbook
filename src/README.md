# ðŸ“– Shan-Shan Handbook

**Greetings**! :tophat:

Welcome to our official _handbook_.

> _**"What's handbook?"**_&#x20;

You might be asking.\
Well, if you did, I'm very glad to explain!

{% hint style="info" %}
A _handbook_ is like your **trusty guidebook**, packed with friendly advice and useful information. It's a go-to resource that spills the beans on everything you need to know about a specific topic.

**Think of it as your pocket-sized friend**, always there to help you navigate the ins and outs of a particular subject.
{% endhint %}

So, **whenever you have questions or need a bit of guidance, just flip open this handbook**, and hopefully you'll find the answers you're looking for! And if not, please feel free to contribute. :heart:

### "Who the heck are you?" <a href="#who-the-heck-are-we" id="who-the-heck-are-we"></a>

This is another question you might ask **if you're a visitor**. Hence why you should head to [**The Company**](broken-reference) section immediately.

However, even if you're a team member, it's good to have a reminder for ourselves about [**who we are**](company/what.md), [**what our foundations are**](company/foundations.md), or [**what we're doing**](company/our-products.md).

***

### For everyone

**If you're a visitor**, want to know more about us or need a reminder, you should head to a page dedicated [**for everyone**](broken-reference).

***

### For team

However, **if you're a part of us**, just jump to [**for team**](broken-reference).
